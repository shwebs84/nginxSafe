In addition to the basic measures mentioned in the previous answer, here are some advanced steps to help protect an Nginx server against hackers:

Enable SSL/TLS encryption: In addition to using HTTPS, you should also configure SSL/TLS encryption for Nginx. This can help prevent eavesdropping and tampering of communication between the client and server.

Use a web application firewall (WAF): A WAF can provide an additional layer of protection against web-based attacks, such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. There are several open-source WAFs available, such as ModSecurity and NAXSI, that can be integrated with Nginx.

Use Nginx's built-in security features: Nginx provides several built-in security features, such as limiting the number of connections, request rate limiting, and blocking IP addresses that make excessive requests. These features can be configured in the Nginx configuration file.

Implement access control: To prevent unauthorized access to resources, you should implement access control, such as authentication and authorization, on the Nginx server. This can be done using Nginx modules, such as Auth Basic and Auth Request, or by integrating Nginx with a third-party authentication solution, such as LDAP or OAuth.

Regularly monitor logs and activity: Regularly monitoring logs and activity on the Nginx server can help you detect and respond to potential threats. You can use tools, such as Logrotate, to manage logs and tools, such as Tripwire, to monitor changes to files and directories.

Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can provide additional protection against DDoS attacks by distributing traffic across multiple servers and filtering malicious traffic.

Conduct security assessments: Regularly conducting security assessments, such as vulnerability scans and penetration testing, can help identify and address vulnerabilities on the Nginx server.

Stay informed of security threats: Stay informed of the latest security threats and vulnerabilities by subscribing to security advisories and newsletters.

This is by no means a comprehensive list, but following these steps can help provide advanced protection for your Nginx server against hackers.
